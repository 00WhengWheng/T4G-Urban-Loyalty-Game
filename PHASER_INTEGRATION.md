## 🎨 Adding Game Assets

### Current Assets (Procedural)
- Player: Blue rectangle (32x48px)
- Obstacles: Red rectangles (40x40px)  
- Coins: Yellow circles (32px diameter)
- Background: Simple colored background

### Adding Real Assets
1. Place PNG files in `/public/games/assets/`
2. Place audio files in `/public/games/audio/`
3. Update asset references in game configs
4. Restart development server

Example:
```typescript
// In config.ts
assets: {
  sprites: ['player', 'obstacle', 'coin'],
  audio: ['jump', 'collect', 'background'],
  textures: ['city-bg'],
  backgrounds: ['skyline']
}
```

## 🔌 Backend Integration

### Ready Endpoints
The games are designed to integrate with these backend endpoints:

```typescript
// Game results
POST /api/games/results
{
  gameId: string,
  score: number,
  duration: number,
  completed: boolean,
  bonus?: { type: string, multiplier: number }
}

// Leaderboards
GET /api/games/leaderboard/:gameId
POST /api/games/leaderboard

// Achievements
POST /api/users/achievements
GET /api/users/achievements
```

### Current Data Flow
1. Game completes → Score calculated
2. Achievement system checks for unlocks
3. Game store updates user stats
4. Toast notifications show results
5. Ready for backend API calls

## 🎮 Game Configuration

Each game is configured with:

```typescript
